# Introduction to The Open Archaeobotanist Guest Blogs


Over this year, there are going to be a series of guest blogs by prominent Open Archaeologists to promote open science as an approach within Archaeology.


This series of guest blogs is to act as inspiration and motivation to our discipline to adopt more open ways of working. 


I think to encourage more archaeologists to follow this approach, we need to explain more about why and how we became open archaeologists to those that have not yet shifted their practices and suggest ways that they could start to move into open science.


The guest blog is based on a set of interview questions that can be found here. If you want to be a guest blogger then please get in touch with me - ekaroune@googlemail.com or you can comment on this issue on the github repository for this blog.


So, even though I have already written a post about why I want to be an open archaeologists, I thought it would be a good place to start if I answered the interview questions.


# Why I am an Open Archaeobotanist. 


## Why did you become an Open Archaeologist?
I re-entered academia a few years ago after having a long break being a science teacher and I think my current focus on open science stems from the time I have spent teaching. Thinking back to when I did my PhD, I think I always had open science in my mind, even though it was not really a thing back then. But teaching students about scientific methodology and how scientists concentrate on scientific design to get valid results feels like something I have to now live up to. When I did start back in academia and discovered the reproducibility crisis happening, I felt even more of a responsibility to practice what I had been preaching to those students.  


The other thing that drives me forward is how hard it is for excluded groups such as women, especially mothers, people with disabilities and those from lower income countries to get a fair chance at an academic career. I really do think that open science can improve this situation as it places more value on diversity and inclusion in lots of different ways. Making sure that you share your research as openly as possible will have the greatest impact for you, on other researchers that can access it and doing this will make your research more sustainable. So by sharing, I do not just mean as scientific publications - I mean all types of scientific outputs and to as wide an audience as possible. That could be lay summaries, blogs, data, code, educational material and also more academic forms of writing. 




## How did you become an open archaeologist?
I definitely started off with a frustration at a lack of reproducibility in my own discipline and so started to teach myself about open science through online resources such as the courses that are freely available on the FOSTER website.




## What is your biggest frustration at the moment in terms of the adoption of open science practices in archaeology?






## What is the most inspirational piece of open research you have seen lately?








## What one thing could archaeological researchers do to easily make their work more open?








Thanks for taking the time to fill in this template. 


I will send you the link when it is up on my blog.
