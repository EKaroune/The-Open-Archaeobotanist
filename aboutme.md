## I'm Dr Emma Karoune

![EK avatar](../asset/img/EK avatar.jpg)

I work as an archaeobotanist. This is a scientist that examines plant material from archaeological sites to find out about the use of plants and also how landscapes might have been changed by humans. I specialise in [macro-botanical remains](https://www.theposthole.org/read/article/222), which are seeds and other larger plant bits that have often been charred or waterlogged so that they are preserved. But I also specialise in [phytoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytolith), which are silica shapes that form within and between cells of living plants. These become deposited in the soil when the plant dies and can be preserved for thousands of years.

### I'm currently working on two projects:
1. _British phytolith project_ - This is a project to develop a new innovative method for using phytolith remains on British Archaeological sites. I am working on a reference collection at the moment of Southern British Ppant communities including saltmarshes, grazing marshes and shingle/sand dunes. Here's a [blog](https://solentreserves.wordpress.com/2020/10/06/strange-ladies-with-a-wheelbarrow/) about my work. 

2. _Open Science in Phytolith Research_ - I'm working to raise awareness of open science to my colleagues in phytolith research, to develop a training worksgop to encourage colleagues to use open science more and I'm also forming a working group to work on improving data sharing. The website for my project can be found [here](https://ekaroune.github.io/Open-Science-in-Phytolith-Research/).
