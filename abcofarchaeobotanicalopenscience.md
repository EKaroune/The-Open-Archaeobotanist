## A

* **Archaeobotany**: the study of plant remains from archaeological sites.

* **Article processing charge (APC)**: also known as a publication fee, is a fee which is sometimes charged to authors to make a work available open access in either an open access journal or hybrid journal. This fee may be paid by the author, the author's institution, or their research funder.

## B

## C

## D

* **Data paper**: is a peer reviewed document describing a dataset, published in a peer reviewed journal. It makes datasets more findable and accessible.

## E

## F

## G

* **Gold route**: The Gold route to open access is delivered via publishing an article in a journal. The journal may be an open access journal (pure open access), or a subscription based journal (hybrid open access) that offers an open access option. This is currently paid for by an APC.

## H

## I

* **Issue**: the GitHub term for tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.

## J

## K

## L

## M

* **Milestone**: an event or state marking a specific stage in development on the project.

## N

## O

* **Open access**: the practice through which research outputs are distributed online, free of cost or other access barriers. 

* **Open data**: data that anyone can access, use and share.

* **Open Education**: education without academic admission requirements and is typically offered online. Open education broadens access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.

* **Open lab/notebooks**: laboratory research records, diaries, journals, workbooks etc., offered online free of cost with terms that allow reuse and redistribution of the recorded material.

* **Open repositories**: open archives that host scientific literature and make their content freely accessible to everyone in the world.

* **Open Science**: the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) transparent and accessible to all.

* **Open workflow tools**: apparatuses and services that promote open scientific projects.

## P
* **Phytoliths**: microscopic silica bodies formed in living plant cells.

* **Pre-print**: a version of a scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a scientific journal.

## Q

## R

* **README file**: a document that introduces an open project to the public and any potential contributors.

* **Repository or repo**: a collection of documents related to your project, in which you create and save new code or content.

* **Roadmap**: a document outlining the schedule of work to be done on a project.
