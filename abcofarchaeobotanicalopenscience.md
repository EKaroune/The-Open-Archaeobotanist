## A

* **Altmetrics**: A project that produces article level metrics of scholarly articles from information collected from the Internet, such as social media sites, newspapers, and other sources.

* **Archaeobotany**: the study of plant remains from archaeological sites.

* **Article processing charge (APC)**: also known as a publication fee, is a fee which is sometimes charged to authors to make a work available open access in either an open access journal or hybrid journal. This fee may be paid by the author, the author's institution, or their research funder.

## B

## C

## D

* **Data paper**: is a peer reviewed document describing a dataset, published in a peer reviewed journal. It makes datasets more findable and accessible.

## E

## F

## G

* **Git**: is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

* **Github**: is a coporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It is free to use and is commonly used to host open-source projects.

* **Gold route**: The Gold route to open access is delivered via publishing an article in a journal. The journal may be an open access journal (pure open access), or a subscription based journal (hybrid open access) that offers an open access option. This is currently paid for by an APC.

* **Green route**: The Green route to open access is delivered via self-archiving (depositing) an output into a repository. There are two types of repositories, institutional and subject repositories.

## H
* **Hybrid journal**: is a subscription journal in which some of the articles are open access. This status typically requires the payment of a publication fee (also called an article processing charge or APC) to the publisher in order to publish an article open access, in addition to the continued payment of subscriptions to access all other content.

## I

* **Issue**: the GitHub term for tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.

## J

## K

## L

## M

* **Milestone**: an event or state marking a specific stage in development on the project.

## N

## O

* **Open access**: the practice through which research outputs are distributed online, free of cost or other access barriers. 

* **Open data**: data that anyone can access, use and share.

* **Open Education**: education without academic admission requirements and is typically offered online. Open education broadens access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.

* **Open hardware**: physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open-design movement.

* **Open lab/notebooks**: laboratory research records, diaries, journals, workbooks etc., offered online free of cost with terms that allow reuse and redistribution of the recorded material.

* **Open peer review**: Peer validation process conducted openly on the Internet.

* **Open reproducible research**: The act of practicing Open Science and the provision of offering to users free access to experimental elements for research reproduction.

* **Open repositories**: open archives that host scientific literature and make their content freely accessible to everyone in the world.

* **Open Science**: the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) transparent and accessible to all.

* **Open source**: software where the source code is available free of cost with terms that allow dissemination and adaptation.

* **Open workflow tools**: apparatuses and services that promote open scientific projects.

## P

* **Peer community in (PCI)**: is a non-profit scientific organization that aims to create specific communities of researchers reviewing and recommending, for free, unpublished preprints in their field (i.e. unpublished articles deposited on open online archives like arXiv and bioRxiv1). 

* **Phytoliths**: microscopic silica bodies formed in living plant cells.

* **Post-print**:  is a digital draft of a research journal article after it has been peer reviewed and accepted for publication, but before it has been typeset and formatted by the journal.

* **Pre-print**: a version of a scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a scientific journal.

## Q

## R

* **README file**: a document that introduces an open project to the public and any potential contributors.

* **Repository or repo**: a collection of documents related to your project, in which you create and save new code or content.

* **Roadmap**: a document outlining the schedule of work to be done on a project.
